This Project is about determining the Critical Temperature of Superconductors using Machine Learning Models.

 I have collected the dataset from kaggle. 
 
 The link for the dataset is given below.

This dataset contains two csv files. Both the csv files have similar materials  count = 21264 .
Both these dataset were merged and all the EDA and visualizations and model training were done.
